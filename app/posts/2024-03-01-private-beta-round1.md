## Research aims
- Understand our users (content designers) behaviors, motivations and needs.
- Understand the process our users follow when creating/editing a form.

## What we did
We carried out usability testing to test new design ideas:

### Forms library
- [Forms library (page 1 of 12) - Defra Forms Designer - GOV.UK](https://defra-forms-mvp-prototype-6c025bd15252.herokuapp.com/library)

### Create a new form
- [Create new form - Apply for a county parish holding number in England - Defra Forms Designer](https://defra-forms-mvp-prototype-6c025bd15252.herokuapp.com/form-designer-v2/forms/new-form/form-name)

### Form overview
- [Overview - Apply for a county parish holding number in England - Defra Forms Designer](https://defra-forms-mvp-prototype-6c025bd15252.herokuapp.com/cph-overview/draft)

### Guidance and policies
- [Guidance and policies - Apply for a county parish holding number in England - Defra Forms Designer - GOV.UK](https://defra-forms-mvp-prototype-6c025bd15252.herokuapp.com/cph-overview/guidance-policies)

## Scenarios and tasks
### Forms Library
- Give overall feedback on the page.

### Create a new form – Journey
- Give overall feedback on journey.

### Form Overview
- Give overall feedback on the page.
- Understanding of ‘Internal notes.’
- Asked to add an internal note and give feedback.

### Guidance and policies
- What is your understanding of the Guidance and policies link? What would you expect to see if you clicked there?
- Give overall feedback on the page and subsequent pages: provide contact details, privacy notice and what happens next.

## Who we talked to
We talked to 6 participants:
1. RPA Customer support team
2. BAU
3. Air Quality Control
4. Trade and Borders, 'NI Pets Travel scheme'
5. BAU - Natural England
6. Trade and Borders, 'Move animals to GB'

### Insight 1: Background information
We asked open questions to understand participants' background and story, and to start thinking about the ‘journey of a form,’ where the need for creating a new form comes from, who needs a new form, which tools are used, what works well and what does not. These insights help us plan more insightful research.

### Insight 2: Forms library
![Forms library](picture33.jpg "Forms library")


**Main insights:**
- Clear and very similar to Whitehall.
- Clean, lots of white space.
- Filters – clear and helpful.
- Draft and Live status – clear to some participants, not clear to those who have not used Whitehall.
- A participant expected to be able to click the status labels (Draft/Live).
- CTA 'Create new form' – clear and easy to be seen.
- Expectations to be able to see the forms they have worked on straight away.

**Quotes:**
> "Is that gonna be my own personal form library or is that like everything? Is that all of Defra forms?...on Gov UK I can see my own stuff, but I can also search for everything else. I assume it would be similar." - Content designer, BAU

> "I see I can sort for the newest, which might be what I want to do, or I might need to search for ones that I've worked on." - Content designer, Trade

> "I’d go straight to the form I’m working on." - Content Designer, Alpha

**User need:**
- As a user, I need to be able to see straight away the forms I have worked on.

**Missing:**
- Ability to see my forms straight away.
- Search functionality to find other forms.
- Sort by A-Z.
- Organisations within Defra (Operational Teams).
- Some inconsistency in the labels we use – what is the difference between Published and Live?

> "Published – is the same as live?" - Content designer, Trade

### Insight 3: Create a new form - Journey

**1. Enter a name for your form**

![Enter a name for your form](picture34.jpg "Enter a name for your form")


**Main insights:**
- The name of the form is usually decided in collaboration with the SMEs/policy team.
- Most participants expected to be able to change the form name later.

> "Ideally, it would be together based on what they want the form to do and be based on good content design principles, the style guides and making it clear what the form is, so not just giving it like an obscure number or something very generic." - Content designer, BAU

**Recommendation:**
- 'Holding hands' - Add some copy under 'Enter a name for your form' to set expectations and reassure users that the name can be changed later.

**Difference between the 'name' of the form and the 'title' of the form:**
- A content designer was unclear about the difference between NAME and TITLE. She assumed this would be the internal form name she would give to her form, to easily find it again.

> "The name, I assume something unique so that I can find it again." - Content designer

**2. Choose a lead organisation for the form**

![Choose a lead organisation for the form](picture35.jpg "Choose a lead organisation for the form")

- All clear.
- There are cases when the user might need to choose more than one organisation.

> "We're sort of operating within three areas: Defra core, APHA and DAERA. So, I'm going to pick APHA, but I might want to pick two." - Content Designer, Trade

**User need:**
- As a user, I need to be able to choose more than one lead organisation for a form.

**Team details:**
- In general, content designers don't have this information at hand and work with SMEs/policy team.
- There are cases in which teams don't have a 'shared team email address.' Content designers will input their own Defra email address. This can be changed later.
- A participant working with an operational team assumed she is responsible for the form, because she creates the form, and she was unsure of the policy team or business responsible for the form.
> "I don't know what the policy team are actually called. What business area responsible for this form? I would assume that I'm responsible for this form as I'm creating it and I'm in the xxx team. So that's what I would put there." - Content designer, Air Quality Control

- She continued without adding a shared email as her team doesn’t have one. Other participants added their own email address.

**Form overview:**

![Form overview page](picture36.jpg "Form overview page")

- Overall, the page is clear.
- Looks like Whitehall.
- Participants welcome the 'Change' links.
- Make draft live – It was unclear to a participant where the form will be published.

> "Does it go live straight on GOV.UK? Where is it going to sit? Is it going to sit somewhere separately and then you attach it to a specific page?" - Content designer, BAU

**Internal notes:**
- Clear and useful.
- A specific participant mentioned the idea of some customization, categorization, or parameters to choose from to have a more formal way to add ‘Internal notes.’

**User need:**
- As a user, I need to be able to customize the changes made to the form so that we have a more efficient way to determine the reason(s) why changes are made.

### Insight 4: Guidance and policies
**Guidance might not be the right term to use:**
- Before clicking on the link, some participants expected to be able to see on the next page step-by-step guidance on how to create a form, what can and can't be added to the form. Other participants were not clear on what to expect.
- Once on the page, the purpose of the page became clearer to participants - to provide the right information to citizens.

> "Right. So it's policies that will be citizen facing." - Content designer, Trade

**Participants reported:**
- They don't always have the information that needs to be provided within these links. They would work with the SMEs or policy team who requested the form to get the info they need.

**Provide contact details for support:**

![Provide contact details for support](picture37.jpg "Provide contact details for support")

- The content is clear.
- Participants welcomed the link to GOV.UK design system pattern for guidance.

**Provide a link to privacy information:**

![Link to privacy information](picture38.jpg "Link to privacy information")

- The content is clear.
- Participants would ask the SMEs/policy team for the correct link.
- Some participants reported that different forms might have different privacy information links.
- A participant commented that the text is quite long, and she would not need to read it all the time when using the Defra Forms Designer.

**Recommendation:**
- Consider cutting the content or adding an 'accordion' component to let users choose to show and hide sections that are relevant to them.

**Tell users what happens next:**

![Tell users what happens next](picture39.jpg "Tell users what happens next")

- The content in general is clear.
- Participants found the example very helpful, but we need to make clear that the information about 'what happens next' is different from service to service.

> "I'm not clear if the email is the only option..." - Content designer, BAU

- Participants welcomed having the 'Formatting help' section at the end of the page. One participant would like to be able to access the help in advance, before arriving to this page.
- A preview link is missing.

> "I want to preview this link and see how it looks because I had to use this formatting with the hash key and so I want to make sure it looks good." - Content designers, Trade

**User need:**
- As a user who has used any formatting symbol, I need to be able to preview my copy and see how it looks before saving my changes.

### Insight 5: Form live – Preview link

![Preview link](picture40.jpg "Preview link")

- The 'Preview link' available on the Overview page once the form is live is not clear. If the form is live, there is an expectation that the links are the same.

> "Why would you still need a preview link if it's live? And you have the Live link? I'm wondering." - Content designer, Trade

> "What is the difference? Why would it be a preview link if it's gone live? Why would there be a preview link and a live link. Why two when there’s no further drafts?" - Alpha content designer
