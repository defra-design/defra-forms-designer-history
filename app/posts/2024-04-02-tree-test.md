## Research aims
We wanted to test the navigation structure, particularly the findability of information and labels, how to:

1. Add an additional question to the form
2. Move a page/question within the same form
3. Add additional questions to an existing page
4. Set a different journey/add a condition
5. Add more info to a page to make it clearer
6. Preview the changes made
7. Add notes about changes made

## What we did
We carried out a tree testing exercise.

### Questions asked
1. You've been asked to add an additional question screen to an existing survey, where would you find the option to do this?
2. The page you have added needs to be moved to a later point in the journey, where can you find the options to do this?
3. You need to include a question on an existing page where the answer will be 'Yes' or 'No'. Where could do you do this?
4. On a page regarding eligibility for a particular service, users can only select one option. There will be a different journey depending on the user's answer. Where can you set up these different journeys?
5. You need to include some more information on a page to make it clearer to users how to answer the questions. Where could you do this?
6. You're ready to see your changes as a user would see them, where can you do this?
7. You'd like to write something down about the changes you've made for someone else in the team to see. Where can you do this?

The questions were not randomized.

## Who we talked to
12 participants completed the study.

### Insights
#### Insight 1: Add an additional question to the form
**Q1:** You've been asked to add an additional question screen to an existing survey, where would you find the option to do this?
- Home > Add page
- Most participants went down the correct path.

#### Insight 2: Move a page/question within the same form
**Q2:** The page you have added needs to be moved to a later point in the journey, where can you find the options to do this?
- Home > Links > Add a link
- This was the worst performing task in the study, with a 0% success rate and the poorest directness.
- Links is a poor label for repositioning questions in the survey.

#### Insight 3: Add additional questions to an existing page
**Q3:** You need to include a question on an existing page where the answer will be 'Yes' or 'No'. Where could you do this?
- Home > Edit page > Create component > Selection fields > YesNo
- The directness is quite high, suggesting that the first part of the journey makes sense.
- The 5 direct successes appear to be participants who have already traversed the tree in the previous question.
- There is a cross-category issue with the option to add radio buttons. We saw this while talking directly to users.

#### Insight 4: Set a different journey/add a condition
**Q4:** On a page regarding eligibility for a particular service, users can only select one option. There will be a different journey depending on the user's answer. Where can you set up these different journeys?
- Home > Conditions > Add condition
- Users are familiar with the word condition. The point in the journey of creating a form where this condition will be added is the issue.
- The Edit page journey might be viable in the final design, but it's worth noting that both options might be necessary to account for different use cases.

#### Insight 5: Add more info to a page to make it clearer
**Q5:** You need to include some more information on a page to make it clearer to users how to answer the questions. Where could you do this?
- Home > Edit page > Create component > Content > Details
- Home > Edit page > Create component > Content > Guidance
- Home > Edit page > Create component > Content > Example callout
- This question had the most possible correct answers, as the question didn't explain what type of additional information would be relevant.
- Most users nominated Guidance as the correct answer, with one user going back from this page before reselecting it again. Poorer directness here can be attributed to users trying to decide where to go from the component label.
- This suggests users who struggled with this question did so because they did not see this type of content as a 'component'.

#### Insight 6: Preview the changes made
**Q6:** You're ready to see your changes as a user would see them, where can you do this?
- Home > Edit page > Preview
- This question had one of the lowest directness scores for its success rate, and this is largely due to where the label appears in the design.
- This is a strong argument to have a preview both per question and at a higher level for the whole journey, but to be clear about which is which.

#### Insight 7: Add notes about changes made
**Q7:** You'd like to write something down about the changes you've made for someone else in the team to see. Where can you do this?
- Home > Internal notes
- ‘Internal notes’ was seldom incorrectly selected as the correct answer for other questions suggesting this is the correct label, and in the correct place high in the journey.

#### Insight 8: Final questionnaire
**8.1** How intuitive did you find using the navigation to answer the questions?

**8.2** Could you tell us how you found the experience of using the navigation today?

- "For tasks 1 and 2 - I would add it to form settings but could only choose the phase banner or feedback form bit."
- "I found it hard to answer most of those questions. The labels didn't make a lot of sense to me."
- "Some names were clearly aligned with the task. Others I had to search for. If I searched and did not find an acceptable answer, I skipped the task."
- "Mostly great! Only the second question -- how to move an existing page. I was stumped, I didn't see an option for that and eventually picked something at random. I also kind of expected the edit options to be higher as there's so many of them. I feel like the options at the bottom of the menu should be for stragglers or one-off / more unique tasks."
- "I skipped a question because I couldn't find a suitable answer."
- "Very hard. One I had to skip as I couldn't work out where you would move a page you'd already created. I also selected Internal notes for the guidance one as couldn't find a suitable option. But later discovered what 'Internal notes' meant."
- "Not intuitive for the tasks described. Given how opaque these felt and how there were sub-sub-menus, I would prefer fewer, broader categories for the options presented."
- "It was okay as there weren't too many options, but I really didn't find the labels intuitive. I think there's a risk they're still a bit internal jargony. Finding how to add components was relatively straightforward, but I was stumped by one of the early questions for how to move a page to later in the journey."
- "More difficult than expected - I didn't find it very easy to work out where to complete tasks. For a few of the questions I had to click into several options before finding what I thought was correct."
- "Fine."

**8.3** Additional comments
- "It would be good to have an optional notes section for each question."
- "Can you make this more consistent with GOV.UK Forms where that's appropriate?"
- "Consistency is helpful - it jars slightly to go from actions (Add page) to general titles (components, internal note)."
- "The headings weren't very clear to me - I wasn't sure what to expect when clicking on most of them, and other things weren't where I would expect to find them."
- "I was expecting to see a way to edit an existing question and a preview option."
