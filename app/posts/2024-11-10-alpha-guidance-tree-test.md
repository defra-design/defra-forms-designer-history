## Background
User research has shown that, before using DXT, content designers need upfront understanding of:
- which information SMEs need to collect from members of the public
- how to design easy to use and accessible online forms for GOV.UK.

DXT guidance will help Defra content designers and meet their user needs. In October 2024, we carried out a card sort study which showed some inconsistencies in how users would group content together.

## Research aims
We wanted to understand if users were able to find the information they were looking for.

## What we did
We carried out a tree test study to test the changes we made after the card sort study.

A tree test study helped us understand where users would expect to find specific information within the guidance.

It is a task-based research method where we ask participants to look for key resources.

## What we tested

### The tree
We tested the tree shown below:

![A screenshot showing a tree-style navigation panel with various sections. The "Home" section is expanded, revealing several sub-sections: "Before you start," "Accessibility," "The form making process," "Designing the form," "Form pages on GOV.UK," "Privacy notices," "After you’ve published," and "Help." There are also options to "Expand all" or "Collapse all," and an "Export" button.](01.jpg "Tree-style navigation panel showing sections related to form creation and publication.")

### The tasks
We asked participants to carry out 9 tasks and find some information within the tree.

Task 1 was fixed; it was the first task for all participants, to help them get used to what we asked them to do. All other tasks were randomised.

| **Task**  | **Description** | **Correct Path** |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Task 1** | You have a problem with your form and you need to contact the Defra Forms team. Where would you find out how to do this? | Home > Help > Contact the Defra Forms team |
| **Task 2** | You need to make a start page on GOV.UK for a form. Where would you find how to do this? | Home > Form pages on GOV.UK > Designing a start page for your form |
| **Task 3** | You're not sure if you need to provide a paper form as well as a digital form. Where would you find information about this? | Home > Accessibility > Accessible alternatives to digital forms > When to provide a paper form |
| **Task 4** | You've been asked to make a form that requires a payment. Where would you find out if the Defra Forms tool can handle payments? | Home > Before you start > What Defra Forms can do |
| **Task 5** | You need to add some guidance to a difficult question. Where would you find advice on this? | Home > Designing the form > When and how to add guidance to a question |
| **Task 6** | You need to run a workshop with your SMEs to collect requirements for your form. Where would you find advice on how to do this? | Home > The form making process > Step 2: Hold an initial workshop > Plan a workshop |
| **Task 7** | Where would you go to check if your form needs a new privacy notice? | Home > Privacy notices > Check if your form is covered by an existing privacy notice |
| **Task 8** | An SME you're about to work with on a form wants to know how they'll get data from form submissions. Where would you find this? | Home > Before you start > What Defra Forms can do |
| **Task 9** | You need to ask a question that users can answer more than once. Where would you find how to do this? | Home > Designing the form > Questions with multiple answers (question sets) > How to design a question that users can answer more than once |

## Who we talked to
40 participants completed the study.

The bottom left shows the overall success percentage (77%) and the overall directness percentage (66%), represented with progress bars. The bottom right shows the average time taken to complete the study, which is 14 minutes and 46 seconds.](02.jpg "Study overview showing completion stats, success, directness, and average time taken.")

## Insights
Task 3, Task 4, Task 6, and Task 8 didn’t work as expected and need to be revised again.

| **Task** | **Description** | **Correct Path** |
|----------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Task 3** | You're not sure if you need to provide a paper form as well as a digital form. Where would you find information about this? | Home > Accessibility > Accessible alternatives to digital forms > When to provide a paper form |
| **Task 4** | You've been asked to make a form that requires a payment. Where would you find out if the Defra Forms tool can handle payments? | Home > Before you start > What Defra Forms can do |
| **Task 6** | You need to run a workshop with your SMEs to collect requirements for your form. Where would you find advice on how to do this? | Home > The form making process > Step 2: Hold an initial workshop > Plan a workshop |
| **Task 8** | An SME you're about to work with on a form wants to know how they'll get data from form submissions. Where would you find this? | Home > Before you start > What Defra Forms can do |
