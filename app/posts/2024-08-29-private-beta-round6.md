## What we did

We tested the new design of the ‘Edit page’:

- [Form editor - redesign](https://www.guidejar.com/guides/a3627126-11c6-4849-b5c7-04376c072c69)

### Background
Before creating an online form, content designers work with SMEs to understand their requirements, determine which data to collect, and design the form. They often visualize the questions using tools like Word or Mural.

We created a scenario and six tasks for participants to carry out during the session. Both the scenario and tasks were shared in advance to help participants familiarize themselves with the research session.

### Scenario
Members of the public need a CPH number for land and buildings used to keep livestock for any purpose.

You have been working with the RPA and have been tasked to create their new ‘Apply for a county parish holding (CPH) number’ online form, which will be used by members of the public to request a CPH number.

### Tasks
#### Task 1: Create the new form
Use the following information to create the form:
- Form name: Apply for a county parish holding (CPH) number
- Lead organisation: Defra
- Name of team: Policy directorate
- Shared team email address: SM-Defra-Not-Real@defra.gov.uk

#### Task 2: Add a single question
Ask members of the public the following question:
- Question: When did you buy your cattle? (Day, month, year)
- Short label: Date you bought your cattle

#### Task 3: Add two questions with guidance
Use the following information:
- Page heading: Cattle movement
- Guidance: Tell us when the cattle left their original holding and moved onto yours. This will likely be the same day.
  - Question 1: When did the cattle leave their original holding? (Day, month, year)
    - Short label: Date the cattle left their original holding
  - Question 2: When did the cattle arrive on your holding? (Day, month, year)
    - Short label: Date the cattle arrived on your holding

#### Task 4: Add general guidance
Add guidance for members of the public:
- Page heading: Record the movement
- Guidance text:
  > You must record the movement in the animal’s passport within 36 hours of its arrival. If the animal leaves your holding sooner than this, record the movement on and off your holding before it leaves.

#### Task 5: Add questions for each individual cow
Repeat the questions from Task 3 for each individual cow:
- Min: 2
- Max: 25
- Name for the set of questions: Cow

#### Task 6: Rearrange the pages
Make the guidance page (Task 4) the first page to be seen by members of the public.

## Insights

### Insight 1: Create the new form

#### Summary:
The journey to create a new form was tested in the past and continues to be clear and straightforward. Hint text was clear and helpful.

> "It says not to use a personal e-mail address, which is useful information, I think." – Content designer, BaU

---
### Insight 2: The ‘Get started’ CTA

#### Summary:
Most participants found the ‘Get started’ CTA clear. However, a couple of participants were confused as they associated it with GOV.UK service pages for public users.

![ A webpage with a green header section titled "Apply for a county parish holding certificate - Add and edit pages" with the subtext "Create and manage the pages in this form." Below the header is a purple button labeled "Get started." Further down, there is a section titled "End pages" listing two items: "Check your answers page" and "Confirmation page," each with "Edit" and "Preview" links next to them. At the top, a breadcrumb navigation menu displays "Forms library > Overview > Editor."](02.jpg "Screenshots of the first Editor page with the ‘Get started’ call to action.")

> "It looks like a 'Get started' button for the form users, not for me." – Junior content designer, BaU

> "'Get started' to me is like when you start a new service on gov.uk. Whereas here, I want to edit the form, so maybe... I want this to be more like 'Edit your form'." – Content designer, Farming Policy Lab

#### Recommendation:
The CTA 'Get started' worked for most participants. Leave it as it is.

---
### Insight 3: Task: Create a page where you ask a single question

![Webpage with the question, "How many questions will you add to this page?" followed by three radio button options: "1 question" with the description "This is recommended." "More than 1 question" with the description "If you need to ask for multiple related things on a page, like a passport number and expiry date." "None (guidance only)" with the description "If you need to add guidance without asking a question." At the bottom, there is a green button labeled "Save and continue," and a "< Back" link at the top of the page."](03.png "Screenshot of the question ‘How many questions will you add to this page?’.")

In general, the question was clear to all participants.

All participants had no experience in creating online forms for GOV.UK. Some participants had knowledge of the pattern.

> "So, this is kind of like fits the design pattern of asking one thing per page and hence I guess that's why it's telling me that this is recommended." – Content designer, Flood services

Other participants found the questions confusing.

> "It doesn't make sense...on the same page [More than 1 question]?" – Junior content designer, BaU

> "I think this page is a bit confusing because I've not got like a visual of the pages of my form yet so maybe 'How many questions do you want to add?' would feel clearer." – Content designer, Farming Policy Lab

---
### Insight 4 - Task: What information do you need from users?

![Webpage with the question, "What information do you need from users?" followed by seven radio button options: "Written answer" with the description "A short or long answer as text or number." "Date" with the description "A day, month and year or month and year only." "UK address" with the description "A street address, town or city and postcode." "Phone number" with the description "A text box that users can enter numbers and some symbols into, such as '+'." "Supporting evidence" with the description "Ask users to upload documents and photos." "Email address" with the description "A text box that users can enter their email address into." "Ask users to select options from a list." At the bottom, there is a green button labeled "Save and continue."](04.jpg "Screenshot of the question ‘What information do you need from users?’.")

In general, the question was clear to all participants.

> "This is interesting because this reminds me of the kind of fields that you get when you are creating lists in SharePoint [Microsoft Forms]. For example. I think it comes up with like a list of the different types of data that you can ask. So that's kind of what that reminds me of." - Content designer, Flood services

---

### Insight 5 - Task: Create the first question

All participants found the 'preview' feature very helpful.

> "The preview thing is quite handy because you can sort of see how it would actually look for the users." - Content designer, BaU

![Webpage titled "Edit page 1" under "Apply for a county parish holding certificate." The page shows a form on the left and a preview panel on the right. The form includes a section labeled "Page 1:" with a green tag "Question 1 (date)" and asks, "How many times can people answer the question on this page?" with radio button options: "Once" and "More than once." Below are fields for "Question," "Hint text (optional)," a checkbox labeled "Make this question optional," and a field for "Add a short label for error messages." On the right, the preview panel titled "Preview of page 1" shows a GOV.UK-styled question with inputs for "Day," "Month," and "Year" and a link for "Error messages for this question." At the bottom, a green button labeled "Continue.""](preview.jpg "Screenshot of the ‘Editor’ page showing the preview for members of the public.")

---
### Insight 6 - Task: How many time can people answer the questions on this page?
All participants found the question confusing to start with because they had no real context and no experience in creating complex forms. The scenario and task given helped them understanding the question.

> "Not immediately entirely sure what that means. I don't if that means a kind of multiple choices question orIs it a question where people can kind of later go back and change their answer? I'm slightly confused by that question...I wouldn't immediately can immediately think of a situation when I would tick more than once if that's what I wanted." - Content designer, BaU Farming / SFI

> "That did throw me slightly that even though I understand the context,... my brain thought, does that mean how many questions or how many times can I answer each questions? I think I find that question a little confusing." - Junior content designer, BaU

![Webpage section titled "Question 1 (date)" with the question "How many times can people answer the question on this page?" followed by the description "Turn the questions on this page into a set of questions that users can answer multiple times." Two radio button options are displayed: "Once" and "More than once."](06.jpg "Screenshot of a question about how many times users can answer.")

---
### Insight 7 - Task: Adding a short label to a question

![Webpage section titled "Add a short label for error messages" with a description: "If the short label is 'date of birth' the error message is 'Enter a valid date of birth'." Below the description is a blank input field for users to add a label.](07.jpg "Screenshot of the error message label input field.")

The name 'short label' is not clear, but the hint text helped participants to understand.

> "Didn’t immediately understand what ‘short label’ meant, but after reading the hint text, I was able to understand it better. I’d call it 'add text for error messages'." - Content designer, BaU Farming/SFI

> "So that's my error message...add a 'short error message'?" - Content designer, Flood services

#### What does this mean for DXT?

- Why do we use the label 'short label'? Is it for the system, for development?
- Why the word 'Enter' is already written by the system in the preview?
- Users only need to know they need to add some text for the error messages to be seen by members of the public.

---
### Insight 8 - Task: Changes saved message and Add another question call to action (CTA)

Some participants were not sure if they had to save their work before adding another question or not.

> "I don't know if I should save it first, but I'll save it to be careful." - Junior content designer, BaU

Some participants saved their work but missed the success message 'Changes saved' because they were expecting to continue the journey and add another question from the bottom of the page.

![Webpage titled "Edit page 1" under "Apply for a county parish holding certificate." A success message reads "Changes saved" in a green box. The left panel is labeled "Page 1: When did you buy your cattle?" with a green tag for "Question 1 (date)." The right panel is titled "Preview of page 1" showing a GOV.UK-styled question, "When did you buy your cattle?" with date input fields. At the top, a breadcrumb link reads "< Back to add and edit pages."](08.jpg "Screenshot of the Edit page 1 interface with a saved changes message.")

Most participants were prompted to go to the top link 'Back to add and edit pages' link.

> "I'll probably just look at the bottom of the form and expect to have something at the bottom to say like 'add another question'." - Junior content designer, BaU

![Webpage section titled "Question summary" with two rows: "Page type: 1 question" and "Information requested: Date," each with a "Change" link. Below the summary is a green button labeled "Add another question" with an arrow pointing to it.](08b.png "Screenshot of the Question summary section with an Add another question button.")

---
### Insight 9 - Task: Add 2 questions to the same page to be answered once and add some guidance

![User journey for adding 2 questions to 1 page. The first image shows the process starting from the 'Summary' page with a green header titled "Add and edit pages." It progresses to a screen with the question "How many questions will you add to this page?" and radio options, where "More than 1 question" is selected. It then moves to a screen asking, "What information do you need from users?" with options like "Written answer" and "Date." Steps 1–3 are outlined below: "1. Start from the 'Summary' page," "2. Choose how many questions to add to the page," and "3. Choose the type of question(s) to add to the page."](09a.png "Screenshot of the first steps in adding multiple questions.")

![Continuation of the user journey for adding 2 questions to 1 page. The first section shows a page titled "Page 1" with fields like "Page heading," "Guidance text (optional)," and options for how many times users can answer the question. The right panel displays a GOV.UK preview with the page heading and date inputs. The process ends with a "Question summary" showing the "Page type: More than 1 question" and "Information requested: Date." Step 4 is outlined below: "4. Add Page details and Question(s) details."](09b.png "Screenshot of the final steps in adding multiple questions.")


#### Summary:
- **‘How many questions will you add to this page?’**
  The question and page ‘How many questions will you add to this page?’ were clear to participants after creating 1 page with 1 question for Task 1.

- **‘What information do you need from users?’**
  In general, the page and options were clear to all participants.

- **‘Editor page’**
  Participants noted that there is "a lot going on," especially after the page has been saved and the ‘Success’ message displayed.

> "Feels like there's quite a lot going on. Just like visually I've got sort of question here, question there questions 1/2 here, but then you've got your success here like change is saved.It almost feels like when you've successfully submitted a question, all of this stuff should disappear and it's like you're done. If you want to go back, you can go back and view all this again. I hate that I have to scroll all the way down here to get to the bottom." – Content designer, Farming Policy Lab

#### What does this mean for DXT?
We need to re-visit the design / layout of the Editor page to make it clearer to users.

### Insight 10 - Task: Add some general guidance

The journey, interaction and content to add a page with guidance only were clear to all participants.

![Webpage with the question "How many questions will you add to this page?" followed by three radio button options: "1 question" with the description "This is recommended," "More than 1 question" with the description "If you need to ask for multiple related things on a page, like a passport number and expiry date," and "None (guidance only)" with the description "If you need to add guidance without asking a question." At the bottom, there is a green button labeled "Save and continue."](03.png "Screenshot of question type selection page")

![Webpage titled "Edit page 3" under "Apply for a county parish holding certificate." A success message reads "Changes saved" in a green box. The form includes fields for "Page heading" and "Guidance text (optional)," which is filled with instructions for recording animal movement. The right panel shows a GOV.UK preview titled "Record the movement" with the same guidance text and a green "Continue" button.](10b.png "Screenshot of editing a guidance-only page.")

![Webpage titled "Add and edit pages" under "Apply for a county parish holding number." Three pages are listed: "Page 1: When did you buy your cattle?" with options to "Edit" or "Preview"; "Page 2: Cattle movement," showing two questions, each with "Edit" and "Preview" options; and "Page 3: Record the movement," labeled as "Guidance" with "Edit" and "Preview" options. A green header contains buttons for "Add new page," "Reorder pages," and "Preview form."](10c.png "Screenshot of the add and edit pages summary.")

---
### Insight 11 - Task: Add 2 questions which need to be answered more than once – Repeater

The question ‘How many times can people answer questions on this page?’ was not clear to start with but it became clearer once participants carried out the previous tasks.

![Webpage with the question "How many times can people answer questions on this page?" followed by two radio button options: "Once" and "More than once." The "More than once" option is selected, revealing additional fields to "Set the minimum and maximum times a user can answer questions" with inputs for "Min" and "Max" values. Below is a field to "Give this set of questions a name" with an explanation: "Use the subject of the questions for the question set name. For example, if the questions are about pets, the question set name might be 'pet.'"](11.jpg "Screenshot of a form for setting multiple question limits and naming the question set.")

> [After the participant was prompted] "More than once makes sense now." - Junior content designer, BaU

**Repeater** label - was not clear to all participants.

> "Having done that task...it's like a sort of type of question that's a repeated question, that can be answered multiple times. So, it makes sense having tried to do it, if I sort of just saw repeater without having tried to, I'd sort of kind of think what's that? as soon as I've done it once and saw repeater then it made sense....I can't necessarily think of a better term off the top of my head like I say, as soon as I've done it once and saw repeater then it made sense." - Content designer, BaU

![Webpage titled "Edit page 2" under "Apply for a county parish holding certificate." The left panel lists "Page 2: Cattle movement" with two questions: "Question 1: When did the cattle leave their original holding?" and "Question 2: When did the cattle arrive on your holding?" A success message reads "Changes saved" in a green box. Fields for "Page heading" and "Guidance text (optional)" are filled with "Cattle movement" and instructions about cattle movement. The right panel previews the page with a GOV.UK-styled question for "Cow 1: Cattle movement" and date inputs.](11b.jpg "Screenshot of editing a repeating question page.")

![Webpage titled "Add and edit pages" under "Apply for a county parish holding number." The summary lists three pages: "Page 1: When did you buy your cattle?" with options to "Edit" or "Preview"; "Page 2: Cattle movement," labeled as "Repeater," showing two questions with "Edit" and "Preview" options; and "Page 3: Record the movement on," labeled as "Guidance," with "Edit" and "Preview" options. A green header contains buttons for "Add new page," "Reorder pages," and "Preview form."](11c.jpg "Screenshot of the page summary including a repeater and guidance.")

---
### Insight 12 - Task: Rearrange the order of the pages

The CTA, page and interaction worked well for all participants but visual cues are missing to help users recognize the pages.

![Webpage titled "Re-order pages" under "Apply for a county parish holding number." Instructions read, "Use the up and down buttons or drag and drop pages to re-order them." Below, three pages are listed: "Page 1: When did you buy your cattle?" with a "Down" button, "Page 2: Cattle movement" with "Up" and "Down" buttons, and "Page 3: Record the movement on" with an "Up" button. A "Save changes" button is displayed above the list.](12.jpg "Screenshot of the page re-ordering interface.")
