## Research aims

Validate and test new design ideas for:
- Upload files – members of the public page
- Upload files - xgov component page
- Forms Library Search and new filters

## What we did

We carried out usability testing to test new design ideas:
- Members of the public’s view
  - Upload page – members of the public view - Javascript
  - Upload page – members of the public view - No Javascript
- Error messages page
- Check your answers page
- Form designer tasks
- Forms Library
  - New Forms Library with ‘Search’ functionality and new filters
  - Create a form
  - Form overview
  - Edit a form
- XGov
  - Add a page
  - Add a component - File upload

### Scenarios and tasks

#### 1. Members of the public’s view

Let’s imagine you work for a company who wants to carry out some work on common land. You need a permit from Natural England.

You have been asked to apply for this permit. You’ve started filling in the form online and you have arrived at this page. Would you mind telling us your understanding of this page and what you would do next? Feel free to interact with this page and remember nothing is going to be saved.

#### 2. Journey to create the form from the Forms library

What is your understanding of this page? Feel free to interact with it and tell us anything that comes to your mind.

**Scenario:**

Let’s imagine you now want to create the form that you have previously filled in as a member of the public. What would you do from here?

## Who we talked to

We talked to 8 participants:

### Round 3:
- 1 x BaU working mainly with Farming – Whitehall
- 1 x EA - Check for flooding service
- 1 x Find Team, Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI), Farming
- 1 x BaU - Whitehall

### Round 4:
- 1 x BaU working mainly with Farming – Whitehall
- 1 x BaU working mainly with Farming – GOV.UK forms
- 1 x Cefas - Whitehall
- 1 x BaU working mainly with Nature, Forestry and Climate change content - Whitehall

## Background and reminder:

Some participants had previous experience in creating digital forms, some did not have experience. All content designers within Defra will be given training support to use XGov to start with. The goal is for DXT Design Forms to have its own UIs, interaction and content in the future.

## Insight 1: File Upload Public view with Javascript

We asked participants for their understanding of the page, their feedback and to interact with the page as if they were members of the public and not content designers. Insights from Round 3 helped us iterate the design for Round 4.

### Round 3 insights:
![File upload pattern with two files](01.jpg "File upload pattern with two files")

- The interactions, status of the files and the file size were all clear to all participants.
- The hint content needed to be specific. It was unclear to some participants what would happen if they uploaded only 1 file. Would they have been penalized? Also, 1 participant expected to be able to upload 2 files together.

> "I'm just wondering why I'd need to maybe upload up to two. Is 1 file enough?"

### Round 4 insights:

![File upload pattern with two files and updated content](01b.jpg "File upload pattern with two files and updated hint text")

- The content, labels and interactions were all clear.
- One participant asked why we ask to upload two copies of the same document.

**User need:** As a member of the public, I need clear and specific instructions for what to do.

## Insight 2: File Upload Public view without Javascript

As per the previous page with Javascript, we asked participants for their understanding of the page, their feedback and to interact with the page as if they were members of the public and not content designers. Insights from Round 3 helped us iterate the design for Round 4.

![File upload pattern showing a file uploading](02.jpg "File upload pattern showing a file uploading")

### Round 3 insights:
- **Interaction:** It was not clear to all participants that they had to click the 'Upload file' CTA to upload the file. A participant was expecting the file would upload without the user clicking the 'Upload file' CTA.
- **Refresh link:** The link name to ask users to refresh the page could be clearer. A participant used the refresh button at the top of the page rather than the link provided.

> "I'm always in a hurry trying to do stuff like this and I saw uploading that was what my eye was kind of like attracted to and thought I could add another one while that's still happening. So was this link here the whole time then telling me I need? Yeah, I missed it." - Content designer

### Round 4 insights:

- **Guidance:** It is clear. One participant asked why we ask to upload two copies of the same document.
- **Interaction:** It is clear, but some participants still missed the link to refresh the page. They clicked the 'refresh icon' at the top of the page.

**User need:** As a member of the public, I need clear and specific instructions of what to do if there is an error.

## Insight 3: Public view - Error messages - Content

### Round 3:

![Error messages for file uploads](04.jpg "Error messages for file uploads")

- The content on top of the page was clear.
- File containing the virus: It was not clear if the file was uploaded or not. Where is the file?
- There was an expectation to receive more information about the virus.

### Round 4:
- Content, labels and interactions are all clear.
- One participant mentioned fearing clicking the error links at the top because they are red and scary!

**User need:** As a member of the public, I need clear and specific instructions of what to do if there is an error.

## Insight 4: Public view 'Check your answers' page

![Check your answers page with file uploads showing](05.jpg "Check your answers page with file uploads showing")

### Main insights:
- This page was tested only on Round 4 - Content and interactions are all clear.

**User need:** As a member of the public, I need to be able to check and change the information I am submitting in case I made a mistake.

## Insight 5: Forms library without and with Search functionality

After using the webpages as if participants were members of the public, we asked participants to use our prototype to create the same online form/page they previously used as members of the public. We started the user journey from the Forms library, which changed in Round 4 when the Search functionality and additional filters were added to the original page. The new design needs more user research.

### Round 3:

![Forms library with only sorting options](06.jpg "Forms library with only sorting options")

The page is clear in what it offers.
> "I'm assuming the forms that other people have created. I've not created any yet, but I can see all the other ones that people created" - designer

Users still can't search for forms or sort alphabetically.
> "I think what would be a bit weird the fact that I can't search, or I can't sort it alphabetically." - Content designer

'Draft Live' status was not completely clear to all.
> "I don't really understand what this means to have the draught and the live. Does that mean there's already one of the forms on the site and there's a draught being done? That's what I'm assuming it means." - Content designer


### Round 4:

![Forms library with only search, filtering and sorting options](07.jpg "Forms library with only search, filtering and sorting options")

The new design needs more research but, in general:

  1. Both design and interaction tested very well
  > "...you can sort like in Whitehall...it's good!"

  2. **'Search' works very well** - it meets what users need, to be able to find a specific form(s)
     - Apply for a County Parish Holding - a participant searched for CPH and the system could not find it
  2. **Advanced search** - Show all sections - it needs more research.
  3. **Authors filter** - it works well but the list could become too long considering the number of Content designers who will use DXT.
  4. **Organisation filter** - it works very well, like in Whitehall.
  5. **State filter** – it needs more research. It is also available in the Sort by drop down options.

![Forms library with only search, filtering and sorting options](08.jpg "Forms library with only search, filtering and sorting options")

- The 'Sort by' options were clear but not useful to everyone.
- Some participants mentioned to understand the meaning of the 'Updated newest and oldest' but they were not sure they would use them. They see them used for reporting purposes.

> "I probably wouldn't use them. I mean I just search for the name in the search box, or search for the keyword. I personally don't know why I'd want to know which is the oldest or the newest, maybe the status would be good to see. How many you've got live and how many are in draft, that's just for your own stats, isn't it? I mean, you're the content designer, you'd know which ones you're working on. And if they're alive or in draft." - Content designer

**User need:** MET
- As a user I need to be able to easily find a form I'm looking for.

## Insight 6: Create a new form

After interaction with the Forms library webpage, we asked participants to create a new form and go through the user journey.

![Enter name of form, choose lead organisation and enter team details pages](09.png "Enter name of form, choose lead organisation and enter team details pages")

### Round 3 & Round 4:
- The journey was clear. Both content and interaction were clear.
- There was still an expectation of being able to choose more than one organization. Often ALBs collaborate on services.

## Insight 7: Form overview

![Form overview page](10.jpg "Form overview page")

### Round 3 & Round 4:

- We asked for high level feedback due to time constraints and the page had been tested in the past.
- The content and information were clear.
- Some participants were prompted to click 'Edit form' to proceed. This might have been due to being observed and being in a test environment.

## Insight 8: Form overview

![Form editor page](11.jpg "Form editor page")

### Round 3 & Round 4:

- Some participants were familiar with the GDS concept of one question per page. Some participants were not.

**Recommendation:** Add some guidance helping users to understand how to structure useful forms - one question per page.

**User need:** As a user I need clear guidance to help me proceed in the journey.

## Insight 9: Edit draft – Edit page

![Form editor page](12.jpg "Form editor page")

### Round 3:
Participants had mixed views on this page. The overall content needs to be reviewed to cater for everyone.

#### What we did:

We changed the content of the page and tested in Round 4.

#### Round 4:

![Add page with bullet points under page types](13.jpg "Add page with bullet points under page types")

The new design with the 'bullet point list' worked very well. It was much clearer to all participants. More research is needed with different scenarios.

**User need:** As a user I need clear and easy to read guidance to help me proceed in the journey.

## Insight 10: Edit draft – Edit page

![Add component to page journey](14.png "Add component to page journey: add page - back to the edit page - Add component")

### Round 3 User journey:

- The old journey was Add page - back to the edit page - Add component.
- Participants had mixed views. The journey made sense to some, but not to all participants.
  - Add component: mixed views, not clear to all participants.
> "I'm not sure adding something from the design system. Like the details components other elements of the form...it'd be interesting to see what that means. To me, that is add your questions and any kinds of options, any drop downs, any radio buttons, any uploads, file functionality, things like that."

#### What we did:

- We removed one step. Users are now taken directly from the Add page to the Add component page, which makes the journey smoother and helps all participants understand the 'component' label by seeing the list of options.

### Round 4:

![Add component to page journey: removal of the back to editor page between creating a page and adding a component](15.png "Add component to page journey: removal of the back to editor page between creating a page and adding a component")

- Add a component to this page
- Due to time constraints, only a few participants went through the list, and it tested very well. Others were prompted to the 'File upload' link. The page needs more research.

## Insight 10: Edit draft – File upload

### Round 3:

![Configuration page for file uploads](16.jpg "Configuration page for file uploads")

- Mixed views. The 'Hint text' copy was clear to all. The rest of the content and labels were not clear to all participants and needed to be reviewed to cater for everyone.
- We removed the 'Short label' and 'Question label' sections and reviewed the overall content.

### Round 4:

![Configuration page for file uploads with minimal content](17.jpg "Configuration page for file uploads with minimal content")

- The new design tested well. The labels and copy were clear to all participants. The example provided was very helpful.
- The 'Make file upload optional' was confusing to one participant, possibly because we did not test the full journey of a form but only a specific page/question. It needs more research.

![Select the file types you accept](18.jpg "Select the file types you accept")

The ‘Select the file types you accept’ section of the File upload page was tested with only 3 participants because it was added late. It tested well. Participants understood what they were asked to do. More research is needed.

## Insight 11: Edit page visualiser

![Page visualiser with a file upload component](19.jpg "Page visualiser with a file upload component")

### Round 4:

We added an icon in the page visualiser representing a file upload. The page was clear to all participants. They all understood the icon, clicked 'Edit page' to edit it and clicked Preview to view the public-facing page.
