## What we did

We tested the latest version of the prototype from the **Editor first page**:

Specifically, we tested the list of types of information to be collected from members of the public.

![Webpage titled "Page #: What information do you need from users?" with the subtitle "You can ask for more information later." The page lists the following radio button options: "Written answer" (a short or long answer as text or number), "Date" (a day, month, and year or month and year only), "UK address" (a street address, town or city, and postcode), "Phone number" (a UK phone number, e.g., 07700 900 982 or +44 808 157 0192), "Supporting evidence" (a document, e.g., DOC, PDF, CSV, Excel), "Email address" (e.g., name@example.com), and "A list of options that users can choose from." At the bottom, there is a green button labeled "Continue."](01.jpg "Screenshot of question type selection for user input.")

## Scenario

Members of the public need a CPH number for land and buildings used to keep livestock for any purpose, including those kept as pets.

You have been working with the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) and you have been tasked to create their new ‘Apply for a county parish holding (CPH) number’ online form, which will be used by members of the public to request a CPH number.

---

## Tasks

1. **Are you or your business already registered with the Rural Payments Agency?**
   a. Yes
   b. No

2. **What country will you keep livestock in?**

3. **Arrival date**
   Tell the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) when the livestock or animal by-products will arrive. This date must be no more than 6 weeks from today's date. If they arrive later, do not apply for your CPH number now.
   If you do not know when the livestock or animal by-products will arrive, give an estimate. If they have already arrived, you can put a date in the past.
   RPA need to know this so they can prioritise your application.

4. **What date will the livestock or animal by-products arrive?**
   If you keep both livestock and animal by-products, tell us the date the first one will arrive.
   a. Day Month Year

5. **What livestock will you keep? – Autocomplete**

    b. Professional livestock keeper
    c. Meat industry
    d. Land manager
    e. Education provider or trainer

12. **National Grid field number for where you'll keep livestock**
    RPA need the National Grid field number for the main area where you'll keep livestock. For example, if you're a:
    - Pet owner, this might be a back yard, garden or piece of land attached to your house.
    - Hobby livestock keeper, this might be a community allotment, back yard or a piece of land you own.
    - Professional livestock keeper or farmer, this would be the gathering point on your farmyard or main field.

## Who we talked to

We talked to 5 Defra content designers and 1 proxy user:

- **1 x Advisor** – Cefas – Whitehall
- **1 x Senior content designer** – Environment Agency – Whitehall
- **1 x Senior content designer** – BaU, Farming – Whitehall
- **1 x Content designer** – BaU - Whitehall
- **1 x Team Leader** – Environment Agency – Member of Defra Neurodiversity Network
- **1 x Senior content designer** – APHA – Whitehall

**DXT users overview:**
- **Experienced form designers**: These users design online forms for GOV.UK and need to understand what information Defra needs to collect from members of the public.
- **Inexperienced users**: These users have no prior experience in designing online forms for GOV.UK. They need upfront guidance on designing accessible and user-friendly forms and understanding the information Defra needs to collect.

### Supporting user needs:
We have started writing **Defra Forms guidance** to help all DXT users gain the understanding they need based on their experience.

We have created three **user groups** to include in DXT user research to ensure we meet the needs of all our users.

![Table titled "DXT Personas for user research" with three personas: Apple, Cherry, and Berry. Apple is part of the BaU team, updating content in GOV.UK and Defra Intranet, with skills in content design but no ability to design online forms. Cherry belongs to the BaU / ALB team, helping ALBs with forms guidance and no digital forms, possessing content design skills and some ability to design online forms. Berry works in the Service team, collaborating with a delivery team and having skills in both content design and designing online forms. Each persona lists their needs: Apple and Cherry require guidance on DXT and online forms, while Berry needs guidance on DXT only. Above the table are illustrated icons representing each persona.](03.png "Screenshot of personas for user research.")

## Main insights

### Ways of learning

The team has started designing a **Defra Forms guidance** to provide users with the right upfront knowledge before designing an online form or using DXT.

### How users learn:
We wanted to better understand how our users learn to use a new software tool. This will help us decide which tools to use for Defra Forms guidance and where to make them available.

**Key insights:**
- Some users preferred self-teaching by trying the tool out.
- Others used YouTube videos or guidance provided by the tool itself.

![A board of sticky notes summarizing learning approaches and tools. Under "Self taught," notes include learning through trial and error, using tools directly, relying on a design background, and trying new tools like Whitehall Sandbox. "Online course" includes using YouTube tutorials, e-learning tools, and mentions that training courses are unavailable. "Guidance documents" highlight preferences for in-context guidance, helpful sidebars, and accessible guidance documents. "Other tools mentioned" include multi-choice questions, demos from colleagues, and seeking help when stuck, while also gauging tool usability before seeking additional resources.](04.jpg "Sticky note summary of learning approaches and tools.")

#### What does it mean for DxT?
We only spoke to 6 users and need more research to better understand and make decisions about providing guidance.

## Error messages

### Insight 1: Error messages are confusing - Users need to know we are helping them.

> "That little red thing did throw me a little bit because it was giving you a kind of almost like a prefix start to the answer without explaining that it was doing it. So, that did sort of throw me slightly because it felt like I was trying to box me into something like 'we want you to do it this way', but it doesn't explain that. That's what it's trying to do." – Advisor, Cefas

![Two-panel interface. The left panel shows a form field titled "Short description for error messages" with instructions to enter a description like 'date of birth' for use in error messages, such as 'Enter a valid date of birth.' Below, "Question settings" lists the "Type of information" as "List: yes or no," with a "Change" link and a green "Continue" button. The right panel previews a question asking, "Are you or your business already registered with the Rural Payments Agency?" with "Yes" and "No" radio options. An error message is shown: "There is a problem. Select yes if [short description is true]."](05.png "Screenshot of error message settings and preview for a question.")

### Insight 2: Users need more freedom and flexibility.

> "...It might not align with the content or the question. I would like more flexibility on how I write this to avoid the commanding tone. So, I know it's trying to be helpful, but it just feels a bit over-engineered." – Senior content designer, EA

> "I just wanted to write the thing myself because I feel like the suggested little hint text here explains what I'm supposed to do, so I can just go ahead and write something like that." – Senior content designer, APHA

### Insight 3: Inexperienced users need guidance.

> "I suppose the only bit where I'd feel like I needed guidance would be best practice for what to do with your error text maybe." – Content designer, BaU

> "I guess there'd probably be something in the style guide for it, whether like you want full stops at the end of the error messages. I would be wondering whether I should do that." – Content designer, BaU

![Two-panel interface for setting error messages and previewing them. The left panel features a section titled "Short description for error messages," with instructions to enter a description like 'date of birth' for use in error messages such as 'Enter a valid date of birth.' Below, "Question settings" displays the "Type of information" as "Date: day, month, and year" with a "Change" link and a green "Continue" button. The right panel previews the question with fields for "Day," "Month," and "Year" and a section titled "Error messages for this question." The error messages include: "Enter [short description]," "[Short description] must include a day," "[Short description] must include a month," "[Short description] must include a year," "[Short description] must be a real date," and messages about date limits: "[Short description] must be on or after [max days in the past]" and "[Short description] must be on or before [max days in the future]."](06.png "Screenshot of error message settings and preview for date-related questions.")

**User need:**
As a content designer with no previous experience in writing error messages, I need guidance on how to write clear and accessible error messages.

## Insights that need more research before making changes

In this round of research, we heard smaller insights from 1–2 participants. These need more research before making decisions.

1. **Guidance only page** within the 'How many questions will you add to the page?' page.

![A slide titled "Guidance only page" discussing the concept and challenges of adding a 'Guidance only page' in the Defra Forms Designer. The left side shows a screenshot of a page asking "How many questions will you add to this page?" with options for "1 question," "More than 1 question," and "None (guidance only)." Sticky notes provide feedback like "Understood this would be a guidance page" and "Guidance does not relate to a question." The right side includes text explaining that the 'Guidance only page' option might confuse users unfamiliar with DXT. A quote from a senior content designer mentions that the interaction might need to change since the page is labeled for adding questions. Another quote from a proxy user asks, "If I add guidance that could be separate from a question, is it gonna be on its own page?" At the bottom, a green button reads "What does it mean for DXT?" followed by "More research is needed."](07.png "Slide exploring the concept and user feedback on 'Guidance only page' in Defra Forms Designer.")

2. Can **First name, Surname, Address, Phone number, and Email address** be grouped under 'Written answer'?

![A slide titled "Types of information to be collected." The left side shows a screenshot of the form question, "What information do you need from users?" with options like "Written answer," "Date," "UK address," "Phone number," "Supporting evidence," and "Email address." A small preview panel displays "Preview of selected question" with a "Continue" button. The right side explains that most common types of information collected (e.g., First name, Last name, Address, Phone number, Email address) share the same format of 'short written answers.' The text suggests these could be grouped under a single heading, "Written answer," to avoid redundancy. A quote from a senior content designer mentions overlap with short written answers and questions whether these fields could be combined. At the bottom, a green button reads "What does it mean for DXT?" followed by "More research is needed."](08.png "Slide analyzing the grouping of common information types in the Defra Forms Designer.")

3. **Radios preview** is confusing – Remove Option 2 from the preview and test again.

![A slide titled "Preview (1)." The left side shows a screenshot of a form asking, "What information do you need from users?" with the option "A list of options that users can choose from" selected. The preview panel displays a question with two radio button options: "Option 1" and "Option 2." A note in a red box reads, "RADIOS: Radio buttons preview only shows 2 options – it needs to be clearer that you can have more than two." The right side explains that the preview generally worked well and helped users understand interactions with error messages. However, some users were confused when the preview only showed 2 options for radios, despite being able to add more. The scenario asked for 3 options, but the preview only displayed 2. At the bottom, a green button reads "What does it mean for DXT?" followed by "Remove Option 2 from the preview. More research is needed."](09.png "Slide highlighting user feedback on the preview functionality for radio button options.")

4. **Checkboxes** – Allow users to enter options all at once, separated by commas, to improve the experience.

![A slide titled "Checkboxes: A list for users to select multiple answers." The left side shows a screenshot of the form interface with fields labeled "Create and edit your list of options." Five options are listed: "Farmer," "Professional livestock keeper," "Meat industry," "Land manager," and "Education provider or trainer." Below the fields are buttons labeled "Add another option" and "Re-order list." The preview panel shows a list of checkboxes with the same options and a link for "Error messages for this question." The right side is titled "Clear to understand and easy to use," with feedback about the "List of options." It mentions that a user found it annoying to add all options separately instead of entering them in a text box as a comma-separated list. A quote from a senior content designer highlights this frustration. At the bottom, a green button reads "What does it mean for DXT?" followed by "More research is needed to better understand how to design a good experience for everyone."](10.png "Slide summarizing user feedback on creating checkbox lists in the Defra Forms Designer.")

5. Provide confirmation that **autosave** is working to set expectations.

![A slide titled "Autosave." The left side shows a screenshot of the form editor titled "Edit page 2," displaying the "Overview of questions" tab and a preview of a question asking, "Are you or your business already registered with the Rural Payments Agency?" Below, a red sticky note highlights user concerns about autosave: "Concerned if the page would autosave when adding a new page – there is nothing to say." The right side explains that the system does not provide confirmation of autosaving, leaving users unsure and worried about losing their work. A quote from a senior content designer mentions being uncertain whether their work is saved when navigating away. At the bottom, a green button reads "What does it mean for DXT?" followed by "Change the previous CTA to Save and continue? More research is needed."](11.png "Slide discussing user concerns about autosaving in the Defra Forms Designer.")

6. **Adding a declaration** – Users did not understand they could add this within the 'Check answers' page.

7. The 'Add and edit pages' page needs clearer labels.

8. **Re-order pages** – It is easy to use, but users were unclear if they should return to the 'Add and edit pages' page or stay on the 'Re-order' page.
