## What we did

### 1. Submission email for ‘File upload’ sent to the form shared mailbox address


![Email notification from GOV.UK. The message begins with a security notice: "For security reasons, the links in this email expire at 4:02pm on Friday 4 October 2024." It confirms receipt of the form "Apply for a county parish holding (CPH) number" at 4:02pm on Wednesday 4 September 2024. The email includes user details: "First name: John," "Last name: Smith," "Email address: john.smith@mycompany.com," "Address: 10, Northampton Square, London, EC1V 0HB." Under "Documents," it lists "2 files uploaded (links expire at 4:02pm on Friday 4 October 2024)" with links to "Methodology_statement.doc" and "Methodology_statement_2.doc." The message ends with "Thanks, Defra Forms team."](01.png "Screenshot of an email confirming a CPH number application.")

![Webpage from "Defra Forms Designer" titled "Your file is downloading." The text reads, "Once download is complete, your file will be saved in the 'Downloads' folder on your computer. If nothing happens, select 'Download file'." A green button labeled "Download file" is displayed below the text.](02b.png "Screenshot of a file downloading page.")

![Webpage from "Defra Forms Designer" titled "You have a file to download." The text reads, "To confirm the file was meant for your team, enter the email address the file was sent to." Below is an input field labeled "Email address" and a green button labeled "Download file."](02a.png "Screenshot of a file download confirmation page.")

## Scenario

Members of the public need a CPH number for land and buildings used to keep livestock for any purpose.

You have been working with the RPA and you have been tasked to create their new ‘Apply for a county parish holding (CPH) number’ online form, which will be used by members of the public to request a CPH number.

### Tasks

1. **Task 1:** Create the new form using the information below:
   - Form name: Apply for a county parish holding (CPH) number
   - Lead organisation: Defra
   - Name of team: Policy directorate
   - Shared team email address: `SM-Defra-Not-Real@defra.gov.uk`

   Once you have created the form, you will need to carry out the following tasks using the information provided.

2. **Task 2:** Ask members of the public one question that they need to answer only once:
   - Question: Day, month, and year when members of the public bought their cattle.

3. **Task 3:** Ask members of the public more than one question per page, to be answered more than once.

   (Think about when you book a flight online for you and another person; you need to add personal information like name, surname, etc. for yourself and the other person.)

   **Background for the question:**
   The most common cattle breeds in the UK are:
   - English Longhorn
   - Red Poll
   - White Park
   - Hereford
   - Highland

   **For each cow, we want to know:**
   - The breed of the cow (to choose from the most common breeds in the UK)
   - The date when the cow left the original holding
   - The date when the cow arrived at their holding

   | **Breed** | **Date when they left the original holding** | **Date when they arrived at the new holding** |
   |-----------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
   | Cow 1     |                                             |                                               |
   | Cow 2     |                                             |                                               |
   | Cow 3     |                                             |                                               |
   | Cow 4     |                                             |                                               |
   | Cow 5     |                                             |                                               |

4. **Task 4:** Make the guidance page (Page 3) the first one to be seen by the members of the public. Can you please show us how you would do that?

## Main insights

### File upload email for Forms SMEs - 1 proxy user

#### Insight 1:
This is the email received by Forms SMEs once members of the public submit a form with some files uploaded.
The content was clear to the participant even though he was a proxy user.

> "I’m just reading it through, and that looks good…I don't know what I have to use it for in my job, in my role, but that tells me what I need to know. That's my immediate impression."
> – Admin officer

![Email notification with the subject "Apply for a county parish holding (CPH) number." The message starts with a security note: "For security reasons, the links in this email expire at 4:02pm on Friday 4 October 2024." Below, it confirms receipt of the application form at 4:02pm on Wednesday 4 September 2024. The email includes the following details: "First name: John," "Last name: Smith," "Email address: john.smith@mycompany.com," "Address: 10, Northampton Square, London, EC1V 0HB." Under the "Documents" section, it lists "2 files uploaded (links expire at 4:02pm on Friday 4 October 2024)" with clickable links to "Methodology_statement.doc" and "Methodology_statement_2.doc." The message ends with "Thanks, Defra Forms team."](03.png "Screenshot of an email confirming a CPH application.")

#### Insight 2:
Both the interaction and content were clear. The file downloaded with no issues.

![Webpage from "Defra Forms Designer" titled "Your file is downloading." The text reads, "Once download is complete, your file will be saved in the 'Downloads' folder on your computer. If nothing happens, select 'Download file'." A green button labeled "Download file" is displayed below the text.](02b.png "Screenshot of a file downloading page.")

![Webpage from "Defra Forms Designer" titled "You have a file to download." The text reads, "To confirm the file was meant for your team, enter the email address the file was sent to." Below is an input field labeled "Email address" and a green button labeled "Download file."](02a.png "Screenshot of a file download confirmation page.")

## DXT

### How do you feel?

In general, the new design worked well for everyone.

DxT users need upfront understanding to determine which data to collect from members of the public, which questions to ask, and how to create online forms for GOV.UK.

The prototype was described as helpful, intuitive, and easy to use.

      Transcript of participant feedback during a research session
    </span>
  </summary>
  <div class="govuk-details__text">


0:01
Yeah.

0:02
Well, yeah, Good.

0:02
Yeah.

0:04
No, I think it's, you know, it looks, it looks helpful and intuitive and, you know, as, as we know, I'm not used to script forms.

0:17
So I suppose there's a bit for me around, you know, best practise.

0:23
I mean, you know, you could think about linking out to you know, kind of go to K or you know, for the forms builder guidance, which is something they do and they do do sometimes in white, white all as well.

0:43
And the first part of the task, fine, that when I got a bit confused about, yeah, I guess as it got more complicated, yeah, I sort of lost my thread a little bit.

1:01
And it wasn't necessarily clear to me that I was, yeah, what option I was, I was choosing for that, that first part of the question.

1:12
And I can see that it's saved now.

1:13
I've gone back-to-back to the overview page.

1:16
But yeah, having like a save button or something similar, I guess that's what I'm used to in White Whitehall, to save, to save my settings.

1:25
And to me it wasn't very straightforward, but that was coming at it totally fresh without having prepared myself much at all.

1:40
That's my general feedback.

1:43
That's back forward, easy to use.

1:45
I think the only thing why I did get confused was around that the language around asking some that the label.

1:55
It's like what you how you define that repeated set of questions.

### Insight 1: 'Create the new form' journey

The journey to create a new form was tested in the past and it keeps being clear and straightforward. Hint tests are clear and helpful, but a participant was not clear about what we mean by ‘Don’t enter your personal email address.’

> "...personal email address...is it my Defra email address or my Hotmail email address?" – Content designer, BaU

![Webpage titled "Team details" with two input fields. The first field, labeled "Name of team," includes a hint text: "Enter the name of the policy team or business area responsible for this form." The second field, labeled "Shared team email address," has a hint text: "You can only create forms using a shared team email address. Don't enter your personal email address." At the bottom, a green button is labeled "Save and continue."](04.jpg "Screenshot of the Team details page with fields for team name and email address.")

---

### Insight 2: Ask a single question per page to be answered once – ‘Add and edit pages’, and ‘How many questions…’ pages were both clear to all participants.

![Two screenshots from "Defra Forms Designer" side by side. On the left, the page titled "Add and edit pages" displays a green header with the option "Get started." Below, the "End pages" section lists "Check your answers page" and "Confirmation page," each with "Edit" and "Preview" options. An arrow points to the right screenshot, which asks, "How many questions will you add to this page?" with radio button options: "1 question" (recommended), "More than 1 question" (for multiple related things), and "None (guidance only)." At the bottom, a green button reads "Save and continue."](05.png "Screenshot showing navigation from the Add and edit pages screen to the question options page.")

---

### Insight 3: Ask a single question per page to be answered once – ‘What information do you need from users?’ page (list of types of information to be collected)

The labels and hint text were all clear.

The participant with experience using XGovFormBuilder mentioned that the ‘Ask users to select options from a list’ option is the one he uses the most and was wondering if it should be brought up to the top of the list.

> "As a person who's created forms before, this one here [Ask user to select options...] as a user I'd be using this most often than anything else from having created several forms in the past and so I'd rather that was at the top of the list." – Senior content designer, APHA, user of XGovFormBuilder

![Webpage titled "What information do you need from users?" with radio button options: "Written answer" (a short or long answer as text or number), "Date" (a day, month, and year or month and year only), "UK address" (a street address, town or city, and postcode), "Phone number" (a text box for numbers and symbols like '+'), "Supporting evidence" (upload documents and photos), "Email address" (a text box for email addresses), and "Ask users to select options from a list" (highlighted). A green "Save and continue" button is at the bottom.](06.png "Screenshot of question type selection with the 'Ask users to select options from a list' option highlighted.")

#### What does it mean for DxT?
More research is needed to understand how to list the different options.

---

### Insight 4: Ask a single question per page to be answered once – The ‘Preview’ function is very smart!

All participants really liked the ‘preview’ function, finding it very helpful, enabling DxT users to visualize how the question they are creating will look like for members of the public.

---

### Insight 5: Ask a single question per page to be answered once – The ‘Markdown’ in the hint text written under the ‘Guidance text (optional)’ heading is missing some information.

A participant was unclear on how much Markdown it’s possible to use in the text box.

> "I'm questioning how much Markdown can I use in this format. Am I limited to adding a hyperlink?"
> – Senior content designer, APHA, user of XGovFormBuilder

_Screenshots of the page with the hint text ‘Use Markdown to format the content or add hyperlinks’._

#### What does it mean for DxT?
We need to add a quick guide to Markdown to help DxT users in reminding them which Markdown to use.

---

### Insight 6: Ask a single question per page to be answered once – The ‘Short description for error messages’ functionality was not clear.

It was not clear to all participants what we ask them to write as error messages which will be displayed to members of the public in case of an error (the ‘Enter’ word is already written by the system).
Most participants started the short description with ‘Enter…’. A participant started the short description with ‘Please enter…’.

![Webpage section titled "Short description for error messages." The description reads, "Enter a short description for this question like ‘date of birth’. Short descriptions are used in error messages, for example ‘Enter a valid date of birth’." Below the description is an empty input field for entering the short description.](07.png "Screenshot of the input field for a short description used in error messages.")

#### What does it mean for DxT?
The DxT UCD team and a developer are already working on a new idea to be tested soon.

---

### Insight 7: Ask more than a question per page user flow is clear.

The new user flow followed by DxT users to add more than one question per page was clear and worked for all participants.

![A sequence of screenshots demonstrating the process of adding and editing pages in a form builder. The journey starts with the "Add and edit pages" screen listing available pages, followed by a screen asking "How many questions will you add to this page?" with options like "1 question" or "More than 1 question." Subsequent screens show "Edit page" interfaces for adding questions and guidance, selecting question types from a list, and defining question settings such as labels or error messages. The process progresses through various editing steps, including summaries and previews, ending with an "Edit page 2" view showing sample questions like "Cattle information." Arrows between each screen indicate the sequential flow.](08.png "Screenshot sequence showing the user journey for adding and editing form pages.")

	<li>final edit page view: Displays a completed “Edit page 2” with sample questions, such as “Cattle information.”</li>
</ul>
  </div>
</details>

---

### Insight 8: Ask more than a question that can be answered more than once – Add another feature.

The ‘Add another’ feature lets members of the public answer questions more than once, for example a microchip number for multiple pets or national grid references for multiple sites.

Content designers using DxT will need upfront understanding of the type of information Defra needs to collect from members of the public. In our scenario and task, Defra needs to know for each cow:

- The cow breed chosen from a list of options
- The date when the cow left the previous holding
- The date when the cow arrived at the new holding.

We can split the ‘Add another’ feature into the following sections. Below are the insights per section:

- **‘Do you need users to answer the same question repeatedly?’ question**
  - It didn’t work for all participants.
  - In general, users need upfront understanding of questions which need to be answered more than once.

- **‘For example, a microchip...’**
  - The hint text was understood by all.

- **‘No, just once’ and ‘Yes, more than once’ options**
  - Both options were clear to all.

- **‘Set the minimum...’ copy**
  - It was clear to all, but a maximum of 25 was not clear to all.
  - A participant mentioned:
    > “A farmer can have more than 25 cows.”

- **‘Give this set of question a name’ copy**
  - It was not clear to all.
  - The ‘Preview’ helped some participants, but the copy was not clear to all.

![Webpage asking "Do you need users to answer the same question repeatedly?" with an example: "For example, a microchip number for multiple pets or national grid reference for multiple sites." Two radio button options are provided: "No, just once" and "Yes, more than once," with the latter selected. Additional fields appear to "Set the minimum and maximum times a user can answer questions," with inputs for "Min" and "Max," and to "Give this set of questions a name" with an example: "For example, if the questions are about pets, the question set name might be ‘pet’." At the bottom, a green "Continue" button and a "Delete page" link are displayed.](09.png "Screenshot of repeated question settings page.")

#### What does it mean for DxT?
We need to change the copy asking users to give a name to the set of questions.

#### Problem Statement
Content designers creating digital forms need to understand what we ask them to do (give a name to the group of questions which members of the public need to answer for each cow they have) in plain English, direct language, and with simple examples. **Less is better.**

### Main User Need
Upfront understanding is needed to clearly grasp what we ask users to do.

---

### Insight 9: Ask more than a question per page user flow is clear – Overview of questions.

The copy we provide when no questions have been added yet to the page should be an affirmative sentence according to a participant.

> "I'd rather the text to say something like 'add some questions to this page' rather than something that's accusing me of not having anything when I haven't had the opportunity yet." – Senior content designer, APHA, XGov

![Webpage titled "Edit page 2" under "Apply for a county parish holding certificate." The page was "Last saved at 5:24pm." The left panel has tabs for "Page settings" and "Overview of questions," with the "Overview of questions" tab selected. It states, "You have not added any questions to this page" and includes a green button labeled "Add first question." The right panel shows a preview of the page, titled "Preview of page 2," displaying "Cow 1: Cattle information" with a green button labeled "Add another cow." A breadcrumb link at the top reads "< Back to add and edit pages."](10.png "Screenshot of Edit page 2 showing an overview of questions and a page preview.")

#### What does it mean for DxT?**
The copy worked for most participants. The issue can be discussed within Defra Forms content designers.

---

### Insight 10: Ask more than a question per page user flow is clear – List of types of information needed from members of the public.

Labels and hint text were clear, but users need upfront understanding of how to design an online form for GOV.UK to be able to choose the right option.

![Two screenshots illustrating the process of selecting a list type for user input. The first screenshot on the left shows the question, "What information do you need from users?" with radio button options, including "A list of options that users can choose from," which is selected. Below, "Type of list" includes options like "Yes or No," "Checkboxes," "Radios," and "Select." The second screenshot on the right focuses on the selected "Type of list," showing the same options with descriptions: "Yes or No" (allow users to answer either 'Yes' or 'No'), "Checkboxes" (a list for users to select multiple answers), "Radios" (a list for users to select one answer), and "Select" (a drop-down list for users to select one answer). Both screenshots feature a green "Continue" button.](11.png "Screenshot of selecting a list type for user input in a form builder.")

#### What does it mean for DxT?
The copy is clear. Users need upfront understanding of how to design a form for GOV.UK to be able to choose the right option.

---

### Insight 11: Ask more than a question per page – The ‘Radios’ option was clear to all participants.

The interaction and the labels used to add labels for the different options were clear to all participants and worked well.

![Two-panel interface for editing and previewing a question. The left panel, titled "Page 1: Question 1," includes a field for the question text ("Which breed is this cow?"), an optional "Hint text" field, and a section to "Create and edit your list of options." Four options are listed with labels: "English Longhorn," "Red poll," "White Park," and "Hereford," each with a "Remove" button. The right panel, titled "Preview of page 2," displays the question "Which breed is this cow?" with the same options shown as radio buttons: "English Longhorn," "Red poll," "White Park," "Hereford," and "Highland." Below is a link for "Error messages for this question" and a green "Continue" button.](12.png "Screenshot of question editing and preview interface")

---

### Insight 12: Ask more than a question per page – Overview of questions.

In the ‘Overview of questions’ page, with the list of questions asked within the same page, the labels and content provided were clear and helpful to all participants. A CTA was missing at the end of the journey, to either add a new page or go back to the ‘Add and edit page’ with the list of the pages and questions already added to the form.

The ‘Re-order questions’ functionality will be tested next round of user research.

![Webpage titled "Edit page 2" under "Apply for a county parish holding certificate," with a timestamp reading "Last saved at 5:24pm." Below, the "Overview of questions" tab is selected, displaying a list of questions for Page 2: "Question 1: Which breed is this cow?" "Question 2: When did the cattle leave their holding?" and "Question 3: When did the cattle arrive at their holding?" Each question has a "Change" link. At the bottom, there are two buttons: "Add another question" (green) and "Re-order questions" (blue).](13.png "Screenshot of the Overview of questions section in the Edit page 2 interface.")

---

### Insight 13: Re-order pages added to the form.

Some participants used the ‘drag and drop’ functionality, while others used the ‘up and down’ buttons. Both worked well. All participants were able to carry out the task.

Some participants would prefer the system to take them back to the ‘Add and edit pages’ page after clicking the ‘Save changes’ CTA.

Currently, we show the ‘Success’ message and users must click the ‘Back’ link at the top of the page.

![Webpage titled "Re-order pages" under "Apply for a county parish holding number." Instructions read, "Use the up and down buttons or drag and drop pages to re-order them." Below, the re-orderable list starts with "Page 1: When did you buy your cattle?" with a "Down" button. "Page 2: Cattle movement" includes "Question 1: What breed is this cow?" "Question 2: When did the cattle leave their original holding?" "Question 3: When did the cattle arrive on your holding?" and "Settings: Users can answer questions more than once." It has both "Up" and "Down" buttons. "Page 3: Record the movement on" has a "Guidance" section with text about recording animal movements, and an "Up" button. At the top, there is a blue "Save changes" button.](14.png "Screenshot of the page re-ordering interface with detailed page contents.")
