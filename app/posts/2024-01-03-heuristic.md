One of the the first things we did was a heuristic evaluation.

> "A heuristic evaluation is a method for identifying design problems in a user interface" - [NNGroup](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-conduct-a-heuristic-evaluation/#:~:text=A%C2%A0heuristic%20evaluation%20is%20a%C2%A0method%20for%20identifying%20design%20problems%20in%20a%20user%20interface.%20Evaluators%20judge%20the%20design%20against%20a%20set%20of%20guidelines%20(called%20heuristics)%20that%20make%20systems%20easy%20to%20use.)

## Who participated
One senior interaction designer and two senior content designers (core users) took part in a heuristics evaluation. The following section summarises the main issues found.

## What was evaluated
We evaluated the xGov Digital Form Designer's form creation process.

## 1. Visibility of system status
> ""The design should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within a reasonable amount of time"


| What didn't perform well well |
| ------------- |
| The main form builder lacks a clear title, making it difficult to understand its purpose and where to start. |
| Selected elements are not easily visible during keyboard navigation and easily become disoriented and lose track of their actions  |
| The system lacks progressive disclosure, overwhelming users with all options at once and requiring trial and error to understand. There's no clear, intuitive sequence of actions.  |
| when creating a new component and saving it, there is no confirmation message besides the addition of an illustration to the page visualizer component |

## 3. Match between system and the real world
> "The design should use language and terminology that users are familiar with, avoiding internal jargon. It should adhere to real-world conventions, presenting information in a natural and logical order that users can easily understand."
>
| What didn't perform well well |
| ------------- |
| unclear prompts and button labels, with actions like "Create component" not accurately reflecting their functions |
| Headings accessed from green buttons lack breadcrumb formatting, and the mix of verbs and nouns in button labels adds confusion |
| Excessive text, such as in the "Add link" box, overwhelms users, while some components like "Fees" lack any description, leaving users without guidance |

## 3. User control and freedom
> "Users often perform actions by mistake. They need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted action without having to go through an extended process​"

| What didn't perform well well |
| ------------- |
| The "undo" option lets you revise completed actions individually, but lacks a confirmation dialog for deletions, increasing error risk |
| Delete buttons are inconsistently styled and placed, contributing to mistakes |
| There's no straightforward way to copy pages or components, and completing actions lacks visual cues. |
| Copying forms requires a time-consuming multi-step process. |
| User profiles lack restrictions, posing privacy and security risks as anyone can edit or view forms created by others. |

## 4. Recognition rather than recall
> "Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform and industry conventions.​"

| What didn't perform well well |
| ------------- |
| The starting point in the system is not clearly defined, possibly due to the flexibility for creating diverse forms. However, this flexibility makes it challenging to perceive connections. For instance, when adding an output like an email address, it's unclear where it goes or how to locate it for placement on a page.​ |
| Multiple buttons on a single page doesn't facilitate visual hierarchy. |
| The positioning of things on the page may not correspond with the sequence of people's form-making workflow. |

## 5. Consistency and standards
> "Minimize the user's memory load by making elements, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the interface to another. Information required to use the design (e.g. field labels or menu items) should be visible or easily retrievable when needed.​"

| What didn't perform well well |
| ------------- |
| Navigating the page initially is challenging due to the absence of a clear start and end point.​ |
| The system lacks progressive disclosure; all information is presented at once, requiring trial and error.​ |
| Connecting pages isn't intuitively clear, and undoing drags connections is equally limited. |huh
