## The flow
The as-is flow of the xGov digital form builder, only asked for a form name. Content designers emphasised the need for them to connect forms to a lead organisation (e.g., APHA). They also emphasised the need to add SME and policy details for each newly created form and they found that the input box was too small for the number of characters usually needed for form names.

### 1. Enter a name for your form
![1. Enter a name for your form](01-name.png "Text input box to enter a form name")

### Validation
- Check no other form has the same name

### 2. Choose a lead organisation for this form
![1. Enter a name for your form](02-org.png "Text input box to enter a form name")

### Why this question
To enable future iterations to group forms my organisation within Defra.

### 3. Team details
![1. Enter a name for your form](03-team.png "Text input box to enter a form name")

### Why this question
To make it easier for handing over forms to colleagues so that they know who to contact and engage with in the development of a form. There was a data privacy concern raised about naming individual by name and we therefore decided to keep it broader to just a team name.
