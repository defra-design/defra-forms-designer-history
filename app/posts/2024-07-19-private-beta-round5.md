## Research aims

Validate and test new design ideas for the new Add another feature, pages available for members of the public and content designers using XGov.

---
## What we did

We carried out usability testing to test new design ideas:

### 1. Members of the public's view - [Take your pets abroad user journey](https://defra-forms-add-another-96268c772eaa.herokuapp.com)

### 2. Editor - ['Add another' component user journey](https://defra-forms-mvp-prototype-6c025bd15252.herokuapp.com/editor-pets/4)

### 3. Forms library

## Scenarios and tasks

### 1. Members of the public's view
The summer holidays are approaching. Let’s imagine you have booked a holiday in France for August.

You want to take with you your pets: your 2 dogs, Chip & Chop, and your cat, Luna. Let’s imagine your name is John Smith and you live at 10 Northampton Square, EC1V 0HB, London.

You were chatting with your friend Louise the other day, telling her about your holiday. She mentioned that you might need an animal health certificate for your pets because you are taking them to a European Country. You’ve done your research online, and you have now arrived at this form.

Would you mind filling this form in and thinking aloud? Tell us anything that comes to your mind.

### 2. XGov user journey – Add another feature
Now let’s imagine you are the content designer who has been tasked to create the online form you have just filled in as a member of the public. You have been working with the SME, and this is the information you want to collect:

![A horizontal row of rectangular cards with alternating yellow and blue backgrounds. Each card contains text representing different topics or questions. The yellow cards are numbered 1 to 4 and labeled: "Who - Name," "Where - Address," "Where they are going - Destination," and "Number of pets." The blue cards are labeled: "The name of the pet," "The species of the pet," and "The age of the pet." An additional yellow card with an ellipsis ("...") follows the blue cards.](01.png "Information SMEs want to collect from users.")

Can you please use the prototype, starting from this page, and show us how you would do it?

### 3. Forms library – Search functionality and filters
- What is your understanding of this page?
- Would you mind interacting with the page and telling us your feedback, please?
- What works for you and what doesn’t work?
- Is there anything missing that comes to mind?

## Insights

### Insight 1: Take your pet abroad – Public view

#### Summary:
  The public-facing web pages were tested with 5 participants.

  In general, the journey, content, and interaction were clear to all participants.

> "It's pretty simple and straightforward. It makes sense."
> – Content designer, BaU

#### Recommendation:
Minor changes can improve the overall user experience.

---
### Insight 2: Public view - Add pets

#### Summary:
  It was not clear to participants that they needed to add one pet at a time. We need to set expectations early in the journey with more guidance.

> "I have made an assumption that they want all of the pets' names rather than inputting them one by one...So I guess I'll just continue and then see what happens." – Content designer, BaU

#### Participants expected:
To be able to add the same information about all 3 pets on the same page.
  > "I guess the first thing there is that I've got three, so I guess I would have expected to see kind of spaces for more..." – Content designer, BaU

To see guidance telling them they need to add information pet by pet.
  > "We're thinking 'Oh, but I have 3 pets. Is it going to allow me to add more than one?' Maybe we need something on that screen to say, 'You will be able to add up to three pets'." – Content designer, BaU

To have confirmation that they are adding information for Pet 1, Pet 2, Pet 3, etc.

The yellow cards are numbered 1 to 4 and labeled: "Who - Name," "Where - Address," "Where they are going - Destination," and "Number of pets." The blue cards are labeled: "The name of the pet," "The species of the pet," and "The age of the pet." An additional yellow card with an ellipsis ("...") follows the blue cards.](02.png "Screenshots of 'How many pets are you taking abroad?' and 'What is the pet's name?'")

### Insight 3: Public view - Age in months is missing

#### Issue:
  The option to add the age in months is missing. Puppies can be months old.

> "What happens if they're less than a year old? Is there an option to put like six months or something? Or maybe there's a rule about travelling with dogs when they're young, when they're too young? I don't know." – Content designer, BaU

![A screenshot of a webpage asking, "How old are they (in years)?" with an input field followed by the text "years old" in a red box. Below the question is a green button labeled "Save and continue," and a "< Back" link is visible at the top of the page.](03.png "Screenshot of the question ‘How old are they (in years)?")

### Insight 4: Public view: Send vs Submit

- **Issue**:
  There is some inconsistency in the labels and copy used:
  - "Sending your application"
  - "Now send your application"
  - "By submitting this application"
  - "Accept and send"

#### Recommendation:
  Follow Nielsen's Usability Heuristic #4: Consistency and Standards. Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform and industry conventions.

---

### Insight 5: Public view: Check your answers

#### Summary:
Content, labels, and interactions were all clear.

![A webpage titled "Check your answers before sending your application." Below the title, there is a summary table with three rows: "Full name: Chris Smith," "Your address: 20 John Smith Street, SE17 2PS," and "Uploaded files: You uploaded 2 files." Each row includes a "Change" link on the right. Below the table is a section titled "Now send your application" with explanatory text: "By submitting this application you are confirming that, to the best of your knowledge, the details you are providing are correct." At the bottom is a green button labeled "Accept and send.](04.jpg "Screenshot of the Check answers page")

---

### Insight 6: Public view: Confirmation page

#### Summary:
  In general, the content was clear to all participants.

#### Issues:
Missing information on how to contact the committee.
  > "If I wanted to contact them, for any reason, I don't know, maybe to chase my application up. Then I wouldn't know how." – Content designer, BaU

Missing clarity on how long it will take to receive the certificate.
  > "I don't have any idea of how long it might take. That would be helpful as well." – Content designer, BaU

#### User needs:
- "I need to know how to contact the animal health travel committee in case I need to."
- "I need to know when I will receive my certificate so that I can plan."

![A webpage titled "Take your pets abroad" with a green banner that reads "Application complete" and displays the reference number "HDJ2123F" in bold. Below the banner, it states, "We have sent you a confirmation email." A section titled "What happens next" explains that the application has been sent to the animal health travel committee, which will contact the user to confirm or request more information. At the bottom, there is a link labeled "What did you think of this service? (takes 30 seconds)."](05.jpg "Screenshot of the Confirmation page")

### Insight 7: Forms library with Search functionality

#### Summary
  The purpose of the page was clear – participants understood what it is, what it offers, and what they can do.

> "...this is a place where I can go in and create a form." – Content designer, BaU

#### Feedback:
  The "Search" functionality and filters were also clear and helpful.
  However, the page needs a design iteration and more research.

![ A webpage titled "Forms library" with a green button labeled "Create new form." Below is a search bar labeled "Search" with a text input field for "Form name" and green buttons for "Apply filters" and "Clear filters." An "Advanced search" section with expandable filters is shown, including options for "Authors," "Organisation," and "State." A table lists 285 forms with columns for "Name," "Last updated," and "Status." Form entries include titles such as "Dairy and milk: model health certificates" and "Pet travel schemes: test for rabies antibodies," showing their last update dates and statuses like "Draft" or "Live." Sort options are displayed at the top of the table."](07.jpg "Forms library page with the new Search, filters, and Sort by functionalities.")

---
### Insight 8: Forms library – Sort by

#### Feedback:
  While "Sort by" options were clear, participants found them less useful compared to keyword search.

> "I would say this is the least useful thing. The way I use Whitehall publisher is I use keyword search to find things." – Content designer, BaU

> "I don't know the point of having that. I think I'd be searching by name." – Content designer, BaU

![  A webpage titled "Forms library" with a green button labeled "Create new form." Below is a search bar labeled "Search" with a text input field for "Form name" and buttons for "Apply filters" and "Clear filters." The page displays "166 forms" and includes a dropdown menu under "Sort by" with options like "Updated (newest)," "Updated (oldest)," "Status," "Form name (A to Z)," and "Form name (Z to A)." A table below lists forms with columns for "Name," "Last updated," and "Status." Example entries include "Bluetongue: movement licence" with a status of "Live."](08.jpg "Screenshot of the Forms library with Sort by selected")
