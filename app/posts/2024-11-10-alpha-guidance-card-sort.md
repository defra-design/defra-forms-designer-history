## Background

User research has shown that, before using DXT, content designers need upfront understanding of:

- Which information SMEs need to collect from members of the public.
- How to design easy-to-use and accessible online forms for GOV.UK.

Defra Forms guidance will help Defra content designers and meet their user needs.

## Research aims

We wanted to understand how to categorise and structure the content within the written guidance.

---

## What we did

We carried out an online, closed card sort exercise through **Optimal Workshop**.

**Card sorting** is a research method in which participants place individually labelled cards into groups according to criteria that make the most sense to them.

## What we tested

Below are the labels and the cards used during the card sort exercise. We asked participants to group the cards into the labels that made the most sense to them. There was no right or wrong answer.

## Who we talked to

We talked to **21 participants** who completed the study.

![A participant summary, showing completion data, time taken, and location. On the left, the completion section shows that 21 out of 42 participants (50%) completed the study, with 21 abandoning the study. In the middle, the time taken section displays a median time of 6 minutes and 13 seconds to complete the study, with the longest time being 1 hour 6 minutes 25 seconds and the shortest being 3 minutes 8 seconds. On the right, the location section shows that all participants (100%) were from the United Kingdom, with the study being set up in English (US).](01.jpg "Participant summary showing completion rate, time taken, and location.")

## Insights

In general, participants grouped the cards within the original labels.

However, there were some inconsistencies, which we had to test again with a **Tree Test** exercise.
